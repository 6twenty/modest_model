# ModestModel [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/6twenty/modest_model.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/6twenty/modest_model.png])

## Overview

Inspired by [Crafting Rails Applications](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails/crafting-rails-applications), ModestModel provides an ActiveModel-compliant class that allows you to quickly create simple, table-less models. The intended use is to back interactions with external APIs with Ruby-friendly models rather than raw structured data (such as hashes).

## Example

    json = MyExternalApi.call('/some/path.json')
    attributes_hash = JSON.decode(json)
    
    # => {'name' => 'Michael', 'email' => 'michael@example.com'}

    class SampleModel < ModestModel::Base
      attributes :name, :email
    end
    
    SampleModel.new(attributes_hash)
    
    # => #<SampleModel @name="Michael"...
    
## Installation

ModestModel has been tested and works on MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.

### Rubygems

    gem install modest_model
    
### Bundler

    gem 'modest_model'
    
### Usage

Similar to ActiveRecord models, simply create a class which inherits from `ModestModel::Base`. You'll need to define some attributes - this is achieved by calling the `attributes` method passing in the attribute names you require:

    class SampleModel < ModestModel::Base
      attributes :name, :email
    end

## Features

ModestModel includes the following ActiveModel modules:

* `ActiveModel::Conversion`
* `ActiveModel::Naming`
* `ActiveModel::Translation`
* `ActiveModel::Serialization`
* `ActiveModel::Validations`
* `ActiveModel::AttributeMethods`

These allow your ModestModel models to act almost the same as an ActiveRecord model, but without the database. You can mass-assign attributes, add validations, add translations, and call familiar methods like `model_name.human` and `to_json`.

ModestModel was extracted from the Mail Form gem described in chapter 2, "Building Models with Active Model", of [Crafting Rails Applications](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails/crafting-rails-applications) by Jose Valim. This chapter therefore provides an excellent in-depth explanation of the inner workings of ModestModel.
